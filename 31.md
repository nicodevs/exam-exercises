What is the difference between a module and a plugin in Pinia?

#

There is no difference, the terms can be used interchangeably

# Correct

A module defines a portion of the state and its associated getters, mutations, and actions, while a plugin adds additional functionality to the store

#

A plugin is a lightweight version of a module that only contains getters and mutations
