What is the difference between the "v-if" and "v-show" directives in Vue templates?

#

"v-if" is used to conditionally hide or show an element, while "v-show" is used to conditionally render an element

#

"v-if" is used to conditionally render an element, while "v-show" is used to conditionally hide or show an element

# Correct

"v-if" completely removes the element from the DOM if the condition is false, while "v-show" only toggles the CSS display property to hide or show the element
