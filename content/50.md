# What is a plugin

In the context of Vue.js, a Vue plugin is a piece of code that extends the functionality of Vue.js framework by providing additional features or services that can be easily integrated into a Vue application. Vue plugins are designed to be reusable and modular, allowing developers to add functionalities to their Vue applications without having to manually implement them from scratch.

> How can I install a plugin into my Vue app?
> Vue plugins are typically distributed as separate packages that can be installed and imported into a Vue application using package managers like npm or yarn. Once installed, a Vue plugin can be registered with a Vue application using the Vue.use() method, which makes the plugin's features or services available throughout the Vue application.
