# MCQs

This is a repository containing questions.

The format is as follows:

- Go to the `content` folder
- Create a folder with any name using alphanumeric characters
	- For organization, we recommend to use a number followed by a dot and a slug
- Inside that folder include the following files
	- index.md
	- 1.correct.md, 2.correct.md (as many correct options as you would like)
	- 3.md, 4.md, 5.md, etc (as many incorrect options as you would like)

This format allows you to use Markdown in the questions and answers, including pieces of code.
